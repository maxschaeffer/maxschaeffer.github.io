            When Montverde Academy and IMG take the court in Florida for a basketball game someone who's not an avid fan
            of hoops might just see a matchup between two amateur basketball teams.
            For those who obsess over or work in the game of basketball though they know its much more, its a battle
            between two factories of talent where you're likely to see the next star of March Madness or the NBA. For
            young student-athletes who receive high national recruiting rankings, they're under pressure from as young
            as 14 years old to live up to the potential ascribed to them by scouts and media, but how often do these
            stars pan out? What qualifies as panning out? I examined the careers of 15 years (2006-2020) of 247Sports'
            top 10 high school recruits to find the answers.

        <h2>Overall Trends</h2>
        <p>Being a Top 10 recruit makes you a pretty safe bet, but far from a guarantee, to at least earn a chance to
            demonstrate you can hack it in the NBA. Over 80% of the top 10 recruits played a minimum of 82 games in the
            NBA, the equivalent to one full season of action. While a majority get the chance to put an NBA jersey on,
            achieving success in the league is a different story. Just 26 (17.33%) made at least one NBA all-star team,
            while just 10% qualified for All-NBA team. These are not the only indicators of success in the league, and
            there are examples of top 10 recruits who put together what any basketball fan would consider a successful
            career despite not achieving these things. Take an Avery Bradley or Marcus Smart, who have made their
            livings as defensive stoppers, earning multiple NBA contracts and making all-defensive teams. However, more
            common is the career trajectory of a James Young or Samardo Samuels, who after their brief stints in the
            league were relegated to playing overseas or in the G-League.</p>

        <h2>Emerging Trends</h2>
        <p>
            The path for five star recruits used to be somewhat straightforward. Attend a historic basketball university
            like a Duke or Kentucky for a year or two, and hope that if everything goes well you can head to the NBA
            draft. While it didn't always pan out this way that was the trajectory a vast majority followed. As the
            years have gone on the journey for these athletes has became murkier. Some have chosen to bypass college all
            together, opting to play professionally overseas or at home, and for those who do attend Universities, the
            NCAA's new rules on transferring have made it harder to succeed as a young player.

            For the first eight classes in the data (2006-2013) an average of seven of the ten top ranked recruits would
            go on to make at least one all-conference team in their college career. For the last seven (2014-2020) that
            number drops to an average of 5.28 and there hasn't been a season to reach the threshold of seven since
            2016.

        <h2>Other Notes</h2>
<p>There are two true contenders for the best overall recruiting class of the 15 year period: 2007 and 2016. 2016 is the only season in which all 10 players both were selected in the first round of the NBA draft and played a minimum of 82 games. The class produced a joint high three all-stars (Bam Adebayo, De'Aaron Fox, and Jayson Tatum) and an all-pro. 2007 is the only class where all 10 players earned all-conference honors in college, while eight were first round picks and nine notched 82 NBA games. Crucially the 2007 class has Derrick Rose who is one of just two top 10 recruits in the last 20 years of recruiting classes to take home a MVP. I think the MVP is the tiebreaker in this case making 2007 the best class.</p>
<p>
    The fact that Rose is one of just two to win the NBA's highest honor (alongside Kevin Durant) is indicative of the shift to more European players, like Nikola Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo, who aren't considered in American high school rankings taking the reigns as some of the best in the world. No top 10 recruit has earned the award since the 2008 class.</p>
