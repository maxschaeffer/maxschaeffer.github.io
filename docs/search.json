    "text": "To start I loaded the required libraries for this project.\n\n\nCode\nsuppressMessages(library(tidyverse))\nsuppressMessages(library(scales))\n\n\nThen, I’ll load in both libraries.\n\n\nCode\nsuppressMessages(twentyfour_plays &lt;- read_csv(\"https://dwillis.github.io/sports-data-files/footballlogs24.csv\"))\nsuppressMessages(twentyfive_plays &lt;- read_csv(\"https://thescoop.org/sports-data-files/footballlogs25.csv\"))\n\n\nThen I had to isolate our Big Ten teams, and add a column that has the total plays for each team in the conference.\n\n\nCode\ntwentyfour_btn &lt;- twentyfour_plays |&gt; filter(Conference == \"Big Ten Conference\") |&gt;  group_by(TeamFull) |&gt; summarise(total_plays = sum(TotalPlays), avg_plays = mean(TotalPlays))\n  \ntwentyfive_btn &lt;- twentyfive_plays |&gt; filter(Conference == \"Big Ten Conference\") |&gt;  group_by(TeamFull) |&gt; summarise(total_plays = sum(TotalPlays), avg_plays = mean(TotalPlays))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=twentyfour_btn, \n    aes( \n      x=reorder (TeamFull, avg_plays), \n        weight=avg_plays\n  )\n  ) +\nscale_y_continuous(labels=comma) + \n  labs(\n    title=\"2024 Big Ten Avg Plays by Team\", \n    x=\"School\", \n    y=\"Plays Per Game Ran\"\n) +\n    theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI copy and pasted that code, but plugged in the 2025 data.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=twentyfive_btn, \n    aes( \n      x=reorder (TeamFull, avg_plays), \n        weight=avg_plays\n  )\n  ) +\nscale_y_continuous(labels=comma) + \n  labs(\n    title=\"2025 Big Ten Avg Plays by Team\", \n    x=\"School\", \n    y=\"Plays Per Game Ran\"\n) +\n    theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons why a Big Ten offense would have a high tempo. In the case of the 2025 Indiana Hoosiers or 2024 Oregon Ducks, maybe your an effective uptempo offense who is using no-huddle to get up and down the field on opponents. Or in the case of the 2024 and 2025 leaders in plays per game, maybe your a poor football team who’s offense is constantly stuck on the field. These charts dmeonstrate that total plays are not an effective predictor of team success, although they can be an interesting indicator of your team’s style and system."
