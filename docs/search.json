Or in the case of the 2024 and 2025 leaders in plays per game, maybe your a poor football team who’s offense is constantly stuck on the field. These charts dmeonstrate that total plays are not an effective predictor of team success, although they can be an interesting indicator of your team’s style and system."

The most stark difference in their distribution is that almost 5% more of Nebraska’s points come from kills than the Terps. Maryland seems to be lagging behind the conference’s elite in it’s ability to finish points the simnple way. Interestingly, Maryland has more total aces than Nebraska on the year, so the Terps have been relying on the strong serves of players like Lily Wagner to create advantages. The teams have a similar proportion of blocks, while Nebraska generates more opponent errors proportionally suggesting Maryland needs to do a better job of extending rallies to and making their opponent hit returns."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Many Maryland fans were outraged at Mike Locksley’s passive decision to run the ball late in Maryland football’s game against Illinois eventually leading to them tying the game with a field goal and then losing. How common is a run play in those situations though? Lets find out. To start I’m going to load my required library and college football pxp data for the last five years.\n\n\nCode\nsuppressMessages(library(tidyverse))\nsuppressMessages(library(cfbfastR))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlogs &lt;- load_cfb_pbp(season = 2021:2025)\n\n\nNow we’ll isolate the third and six plays.\n\n\nCode\nthird_and_six &lt;- logs |&gt; filter(down == 3, distance == 6) \n\nthird_and_six_summary &lt;- third_and_six |&gt; group_by(play_type) |&gt; summarise(total_plays=n()) \n\n\nAccording to the data Locksley’s decision was passive, but not entirely uncommon, over the last five seasons team have ran the ball 3,362 times on third and six, good for just over 20% of the third and six plays.\n\n\nCode\nthird_and_six_summary |&gt;  summarise(overall_sum = sum(total_plays), rush_pct = 3362/overall_sum)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  overall_sum rush_pct\n        &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1       16447    0.204\n\n\nTeams have actually found decent success doing this gaining an average of just under 5.7 yards, although this does include quarter back runs and improvised scrambles.\n\n\nCode\nthird_and_six |&gt; filter(play_type == \"Rush\") |&gt; summarise(avg_yds_gained = mean(yards_gained))\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  avg_yds_gained\n           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1           5.69\n\n\nWhich teams have ran the most in this situation in a single season? To the suprise of no CFB fans the top spot belongs to Navy who ran it 16 times in third and six situations in 2022. No Maryland teams are in the upper echelon of third and six runs in a single season.\n\n\nCode\nthird_and_six_runs &lt;- third_and_six |&gt; filter(play_type == \"Rush\")\n\nthird_and_six_runs &lt;- third_and_six_runs |&gt;\n  group_by(season, team) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_runs = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_runs))\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'season'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nNow lets compare Locksley’s Terps teams to the rest of the nation.\n\n\nCode\nmdthird_and_six &lt;- logs |&gt; filter(team == \"Maryland\", down == 3, distance == 6) \n\nmdthird_and_six_summary &lt;- mdthird_and_six |&gt; group_by(play_type) |&gt; summarise(total_plays=n()) \n\n\nOut of 71 third and six situations Maryland has been in, they have ran the ball 15 times, good for 21.1% of the time and just a tick above the national average.\n\n\nCode\nmdthird_and_six_summary |&gt;  summarise(overall_sum = sum(total_plays), rush_pct = 15/overall_sum)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  overall_sum rush_pct\n        &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1          71    0.211\n\n\nNow a fact that might suprise many Terps fans, they’ve achieved some decent success on these run plays, gaining an average of six yards per play getting them exactly to the line to the gain.\n\n\nCode\nmdthird_and_six |&gt; filter(play_type == \"Rush\") |&gt; summarise(avg_yds_gained = mean(yards_gained))\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  avg_yds_gained\n           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1              6\n\n\nLastly, I wanted to take a look at if Locksley and the Terps tendencies have changed in these situations over the years. The answer is slightly. 2022 was an all-time high with five run plays on third and six, since then it’s been on the way down with just 2 in 2024 and one so far in 2025.\n\n\nCode\nmdthird_and_six_runs &lt;- mdthird_and_six |&gt; filter(play_type == \"Rush\")\n\nmd_third_and_six_runs &lt;- mdthird_and_six_runs |&gt;\n  group_by(season, team) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_runs = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_runs))\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'season'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nthird_and_six_runs &lt;- third_and_six_runs |&gt; group_by(season) |&gt; summarise(mean_rushes = mean(total_runs))\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncomparison &lt;- left_join(md_third_and_six_runs, third_and_six_runs, by = \"season\")\n\n\ncomparison_long &lt;- comparison |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(total_runs, mean_rushes),\n    names_to = \"type\",\n    values_to = \"runs\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(comparison_long, aes(x = factor(season), y = runs, fill = type)) +\n  geom_col(position = position_dodge(width = 0.7)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"How often does Maryland run on third and six vs the field\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Number of Runs\",\n    fill = \"\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"total_runs\" = \"#D50032\", \"mean_rushes\" = \"gray70\"),\n    labels = c (\"National Average\", \"Maryland\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization shows how the Terps have stacked up to the national average of third and six run plays in any given season. In three out of the five most recent seasons they’ve been below it with 2022 being the biggest outlier.\nWhile the data doesn’t take into account time, score, and game script, from a statistical standpoint Maryland isn’t a particularly passive team compared to the rest of the country. Beyond that Locksley’s best argument for the run call is that on average running the ball in that situation has meant the Terps moved the chains. Still, in recent years Maryland has seemed to favor dropping back to pass and ran it less than everyone else in the country."

The conference shifted to more air raid offenses that relied heavily on their quarterbacks to varying degrees of success like CJ Stroud (Ohio State), Taulia Tagovailoa (Maryland) and Aidan O’Connell (Purdue).\nIn the years since 2021, the numbers have normalized returning closer to their 2020 and before levels, but they have remained above 5%.\nSome teams like Penn State can be relied upon to produce at least one win a season in which they rush for under 100 yards. The Nittany Lions played a large factor in the 2021 spike picking up four of their seven wins with under 100 rushing yards.\nThe Nittany Lions are also a primary example that the change can’t only be explained as a shift in offensive philosophy. They were able to win games without having to generate much offense at all, allowing under 12 points per game in wins aided by shutouts of Indiana and Rutgers.\nAlso the increased number still represents a small percent of total wins. The national champions in 2021 were the Georgia Bulldogs who netted over 100 yards rushing in every single one of their games behind an NFL backfield of Zamir White and James Cook.\n\n\nCode\nlogs &lt;- read_csv(\"https://dwillis.github.io/sports-data-files/footballlogs1525.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 17133 Columns: 79\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (11): Location, Opponent, Result, OT, Bowl.x, TeamURL, Outcome, Bowl.y,...\ndbl  (64): Rk, Gtm, Points, PointsOpp, PassCmp, PassAtt, PassPct, PassYds, P...\nlgl   (3): Score, TeamScore, OpponentScore\ndate  (1): Date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\n# the Season is the year, of the game except when the game's in January.

There can be no debate that the school made the right decision financially, but it moved the football team into a much tougher conference where they’ve struggled to compete. How has maryland fared compared to the national averages in yards gained and allowed per game across its first 11 seasons?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=ypp, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.562701) +\n      geom_vline(xintercept = 5.811255) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=ypp, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label=Season)\n  )  + labs(title=\"Maryland's mixed bag Big Ten era\", subtitle=\"The Terps have had more below average seasons then not since joining the conference*\", caption=\"*2025 season in progress  Source: NCAA | By Max Schaeffer\")  + theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaryland’s had two seasons where it was on the positive side of the national average both offensively and defensively. One being the 2020 season where the Terps played just five games and won 2 and the other being an eight win season in 2023. When the Terps made three straight bowl games, from 2021-2023 they were above average in at least one category all three years.\nTheir most populated quadrant is the one they will be most anxious to avoid with five seasons of below average production on both sides of the ball. While he has become a recent target of Maryland fan’s ire amid it’s four game losing streak, Mike Locksley is only responsible for two of Maryland’s worst five seasons.\nThe Terps current season has been one of ups and downs, but the (extremely young) defense has been surprisingly the team’s strength. Locksley and offensive coordinator Pep Hamilton’s inability to generate any sort of rushing attack has their offensive production at one of it’s worst rates ever through eight games.\nThe Terps have four more games against including two against fellwo conference bottom dwellers Michigan State and Rutgers to try and move their offensive production to the rights side of the Y-Axis and salvage what could be year seven in the disaster zone if things don’t go to plan."

Other then them having an incorrect column title of “plays per game” instead of “total plays” I came up with the same data that they had. Next I had to begin looking at the data for all teams:\n\n\nCode\nredzoneweekthree &lt;- pxp2025 |&gt; \n  filter( yardline_100 &lt; 21, week &lt; 4, play_type %in% c('run', 'pass' ))\n\nredzoneweekthreesummary &lt;- redzoneweekthree |&gt; group_by(posteam) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    totalplayswk3 = n(),\n    totalepawk3 = sum(epa),\n    epaperplaywk3 = totalepawk3/totalplayswk3\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nredzone25 &lt;- pxp2025 |&gt; \n  filter(yardline_100 &lt; 21, play_type %in% c('run', 'pass' ))\n\nredzone25summary &lt;- redzone25 |&gt; group_by(posteam) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    totalplays = n(),\n    totalepa = sum(epa),\n    epaperplaytotal = totalepa/totalplays\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndumbell_combine &lt;- redzoneweekthreesummary |&gt; inner_join(redzone25summary, join_by(posteam))\n\n\nOnce I had properly created two separate data charts with epa/play for every team I had to join them, so I could use that singular data frame for a dumbell plot. I used some of the code I used for the dumbell plot from my project as a framework and then put together the data and labels I needed. One tricky part was finding the right sizing since you need 32 teams on the Y-axis.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(dumbell_combine) + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    aes(y=reorder(posteam, epaperplaytotal) , x=epaperplaywk3, xend=epaperplaytotal),\n    linewidth = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"blue\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"EPA per play changes since week 3\",\n    subtitle = \"Green = EPA through first 3 weeks | Blue = Full season EPA\",\n    x = \"Epa/Play Change\",\n    y = \"Team\"\n  ) \n\n\nWarning in geom_dumbbell(aes(y = reorder(posteam, epaperplaytotal), x =\nepaperplaywk3, : Ignoring unknown parameters: `linewidth`\n\n\nWarning: Using the `size` aesthetic with geom_segment was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use the `linewidth` aesthetic instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart shows some interesting trends for teams who have had changes. I ordered the chart by who has the most epa/play currently and the Giants despite having the largest increase remain worst in the league in epa/play. This begs the question: just how historically terrible was the first three weeks of the Russell Wilson Giants offense. Houston has a similar story. Some teams have regressed like my Steelers and most significantly the Dolphins who led the league in epa/play for the first three weeks, before coming down closer to league average.\nMike McDaniel’s creative motion offense allows them to come up with play designs in the offseason that make them more unpredictable in the early weeks. However, as soon as Tua sees pressure the offensive gameplan crumbles and we’ve seen more meltdown games from him and the offense in recent weeks like that against the Browns."

The Terps have largely leaned on a stonewall defense, goalkeeper Laurin Mack combined with a centerback pairing of Lasse Kelp and Tristen Rose have the Terps allowing under a goal per game through the regular season.\nOffensive prowess has come from the wings though where Sadam Masereka and Stephane Njike have excelled combining for 16 of the teams 40 goals this year. Both have also shown themselves to be clinical hitting the back of the net on over 35% of their shots on target.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + geom_quasirandom(data=activeplayers, aes(x=yr, y=goal_pct), color=\"grey\")  +\n    geom_quasirandom(\n    data=md, \n    aes(x=yr, y=goal_pct), color=\"red\") +\n    geom_quasirandom(\n    data=psu, \n    aes(x=yr, y=goal_pct), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=md, \n    aes(x=yr, y=goal_pct, label=full_name)) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Masereka and Njike stand out against other players their age\",\n    subtitle = \"Qualifying players have taken at least five shots on target and scored at least twice\\nBlue = Penn State Players (The Nittany Lions finished last in the Big Ten)\",\n    x = \"Year of School\",\n    y = \"Conversion Percentage\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Derek Willis Chart: Max Schaeffer\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaryland got offensvie contributions from other places too. Center forwards Rocket Ritarita and Joseph Picotto tagged on two goals a piece, but both converted at a rate under 30%, lower than what Cirovski would hope for from traditional No. 9s. Maryland also got boosts from senior left back Luca Costabile and midfielder Albi Ndrenika, totaling four seniors who put up multiple goals on over five chances.\nThe Terps will continue to rely heavily on Njike and Masereka to create offense in the Big Ten and then NCAA tournament, but if teams dedicate extra focus to them defensively, they will have to look to create for some players with post-season experience like Costabile and Ndrenika. Whether those experienced player’s finshing can be relied upon, could be the difference between a run to the Final Four in North Carolina or a dissapointing early upset for Cirovski’s Maryland."

This year, the conference’s elite have mostly upheld that reputation, with top three teams: Indiana, Ohio State and USC featuring dangerous run games each posting over the conference average 4.46 yards per carry in a majority of their games this year. The conference’s average is slightly higher than the national average of 4.28 yards per carry.\nWhile the conference’s elite have hung their hat on running the ball, the conference’s bottomdwellers have also offered some terrible running performances. Wisconsin, Rutgers, and Maryland have all spent most of their time under both the national and conference average. Maryland has one major outlier, in the second best yards per attempt game of the season against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. The best game of the season? Oregon against the Scarlet Knights, who’s run defense is more like a charity for backfields that need a confidence boost."
