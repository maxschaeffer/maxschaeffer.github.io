In the case of the 2025 Indiana Hoosiers or 2024 Oregon Ducks, maybe your an effective uptempo offense who is using no-huddle to get up and down the field on opponents. Or in the case of the 2024 and 2025 leaders in plays per game, maybe your a poor football team who’s offense is constantly stuck on the field. These charts dmeonstrate that total plays are not an effective predictor of team success, although they can be an interesting indicator of your team’s style and system."

The most stark difference in their distribution is that almost 5% more of Nebraska’s points come from kills than the Terps. Maryland seems to be lagging behind the conference’s elite in it’s ability to finish points the simnple way. Interestingly, Maryland has more total aces than Nebraska on the year, so the Terps have been relying on the strong serves of players like Lily Wagner to create advantages. The teams have a similar proportion of blocks, while Nebraska generates more opponent errors proportionally suggesting Maryland needs to do a better job of extending rallies to and making their opponent hit returns."
