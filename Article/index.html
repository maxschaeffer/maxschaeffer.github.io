            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was only 16 at the time
                of his birth.His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in
                his life. When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from
                apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.
                Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to
                move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball
                when he was nine years old.</p>
            <p>
                James began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade.[21] He later played Amateur Athletic Union
                (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[20] The team enjoyed success on a local and
                national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.The group
                dubbed themselves the "Fab Four" and promised each other that they would attend high school together.In
                a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent St. Mary High School, a private
                Catholic school with predominantly white students.
